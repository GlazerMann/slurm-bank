To create projects in your slurmdbd for a given cluster you can do
something like the following with the [[sbank-project]] command:

	$ sbank project create -c mycluster -a myaccount

If you make a mess of things you can delete it by doing:

	$ sbank project delete -c mycluster -a myaccount

Once you have created some accounts you may want to associate users with
the account:

	$ sbank project useradd -c mycluster -a myaccount -u someuser

This will create a user and associate 'someuser' with 'myaccount'. It
also sets 'myaccount' as the DefaultAccount for the user.

If instead you do not wish to update the DefaultAccount, then add
this flag:

	$ sbank project useradd -c mycluster -a myaccount -u someuser -s

you can also remove users from accounts.

	$ sbank project userdel -c mycluster -a myaccount -u someuser
