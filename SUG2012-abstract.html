<h1>SLURM Bank</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>SLURM Bank is a collection of wrapper scripts to give SLURM GOLD-like
capabilities for managing resources. With the SLURM Bank scripts we
are able to provide a simple banking system where we can deposit hours
to an account. Users are associated with these accounts which they use
to run jobs. If users do not have an account or if they do not have
hours in their account then they cannot run jobs.</p>

<p>At TCHPC, we were motivated to replace the resource management and
allocation systems which comprised of three pieces of software (SLURM,
GOLD and maui) with just a single piece of software: SLURM. Having all
of the banking functionality in SLURM has benefits for both the
systems administrators:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having just SLURM without maui means there are fewer things to go
wrong</li>
<li>Overall performance for scheduling and launching jobs is much better
with just SLURM</li>
<li>GOLD is overly complicated and we don't need many of the features
from GOLD</li>
</ul>


<p>And also benefits for end users of clusters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fewer commands/systems to learn</li>
<li>Faster job submission and turn-around</li>
<li>Greater overall system stability</li>
</ul>


<p>The package is not feature complete and there are issues with the
current proposed implementation. Despite this, SLURM Bank has been in
production use at TCHPC for a year with some success.</p>
